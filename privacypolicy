            <h2>Additional Privacy Practices for the Shift App</h2>
            <p>In addition to the practices described above, this section outlines how Shift collects, uses, and discloses personal information when you use the Shift mobile application (the "App") to enable focus sessions, block apps, track screen time, or interact with NFC-enabled devices.</p>
            
            <h3>Information We Collect Through the Shift App</h3>
            <p>When you use the Shift App, we may collect or process the following categories of personal information, in addition to those already described:</p>
            
            <h3>App Usage Data</h3>
            <p>We collect information about the applications you use on your device during focus sessions. This includes which apps are blocked, the duration of blocking, and the frequency of attempts to access blocked apps. We do not collect the content within those apps, only metadata related to usage and blocking behavior.</p>
            
            <h3>Focus Session Data</h3>
            <p>This includes the time you start and end a focus session, the total time spent in focus mode, streak history, and app interaction data during focus sessions.</p>
            
            <h3>Device-Level Permissions</h3>
            <p>To function correctly, the App may request access to system-level services such as Screen Time, App Usage, Notifications, NFC, or other native OS permissions (e.g., Activity tracking via Apple's ManagedSettings or FamilyControls framework). These permissions are used solely to facilitate core app functions and are not used for third-party marketing or analytics.</p>
            
            <h3>Crash Logs and Diagnostics</h3>
            <p>We may collect crash logs, error reports, and basic diagnostics from your device to identify bugs, improve performance, and maintain the reliability of the App. This information is anonymized where feasible.</p>
            
            <h3>Optional Account Information</h3>
            <p>If you choose to sign in using your Apple ID or other methods, we may collect your email address and other sign-in credentials to associate your App usage data with your account for syncing across devices and backup purposes.</p>
            
            <h3>How We Use App-Related Information</h3>
            <p>We use your app-related information for the following purposes:</p>
            
            <h3>Enable Focus Features</h3>
            <p>We use usage and permission data to enforce app blocks, show overlay screens, maintain session history, and display statistics such as time saved, number of app opens blocked, and streaks completed.</p>
            
            <h3>Improve the App</h3>
            <p>Usage patterns and feedback help us identify how users engage with the App and where we can improve features, fix issues, or enhance performance. All diagnostic and analytical insights are used in aggregate and are not sold or shared with external parties for advertising purposes.</p>
            
            <h3>Sync Across Devices (if enabled)</h3>
            <p>If you log into the App, we may store your preferences, session history, and streak data in encrypted format to allow syncing across devices and backup restoration.</p>
            
            <h3>Security and Abuse Prevention</h3>
            <p>We monitor for unusual or unauthorized use patterns that could indicate misuse or tampering with the app's intended functionality.</p>
            
            <h3>App Data Storage and Retention</h3>
            <p>All app-specific data (e.g., session logs, blocked apps, screen time, usage statistics) is stored securely on-device by default. If you opt into syncing, limited data may be stored on our secure cloud infrastructure, protected by encryption and access controls.</p>
            <p>We retain your app data only as long as necessary to provide the services or until you request deletion. You can delete all stored data through the App settings, and you may also contact us to request permanent deletion from synced cloud backups if applicable.</p>
            
            <h3>No Sale or Sharing of App Data</h3>
            <p>Shift does not sell your app usage data, focus session data, or any screen time metrics to third parties. Your data will never be used to build behavioral profiles for advertising or monetization outside of your use of the App.</p>
            
            <h3>Children's App Data</h3>
            <p>As with our website and store, the App is not intended for use by children. The Shift App does not knowingly collect personal data from users under the age of 16. If we discover such data has been collected, we will take steps to delete it promptly.</p>
            
            <h3>Your App-Specific Rights and Choices</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>You may delete your data at any time using the app's in-built "Reset Data" or "Clear History" functions.</li>
                <li>You may revoke permissions (such as NFC, Screen Time access) via your device settings. Note that this may affect app functionality.</li>
                <li>If you create an account, you may request access to, correction of, or deletion of your data by contacting us directly.</li>
